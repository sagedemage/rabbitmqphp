    <h1 class="text-center">Access to the Site</h1>
   <p>It is your responsibility to ensure your computer system meets all the necessary technical specifications to enable you to access and use the Site and is compatible with the Site. We may, from time to time, restrict access to certain features, parts or content of the Site to users who have registered with us (such as access to the Services support program features and pages). You must ensure that any registration details you provide are accurate. If you use or create a log-in ID (such as a username and password or other identifier) as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential and must not reveal it to anyone else. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your log-in ID and must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use or other security breach of which you become aware. We reserve the right to disable any log-in ID, at any time, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these terms of use or if any details you provide for the purposes of registering as a user prove to be false. We cannot guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or error-free operability of the Site. There may be times when certain features, parts or content of the Site, or the entire Site, become unavailable (whether on a scheduled or unscheduled basis) or are modified, suspended or withdrawn by us, in our sole discretion, without notice to you.

   <h1 class="text-center">DMCA Notice and Procedure</h1>


   <h1 class="text-center">NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (DMCA).
   </h1>


   <p>Electirk.com will respond to allegations of copyright violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notification to an online service provider concerning alleged copyright infringement. When a valid DMCA notification is received, the service provider responds under this process by taking down the offending content. On taking down content under the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content so that a counter-notification may be filed. On receiving a valid counter-notification, we generally restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from the notification provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity. Electrik may provide copies of such notices to the participants in the dispute or to any other third parties, at our discretion and as required by law. Electrik’s privacy policy does not protect information provided in these notices. NOTE: THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED EXCLUSIVELY FOR NOTIFYING ELECTRIKTHAT YOUR COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL MAY HAVE BEEN INFRINGED. ALL OTHER INQUIRIES, SUCH AS REQUESTS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, REPORTS OF EMAIL ABUSE, AND DATA PROTECTION OR PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE THROUGH THIS PROCESS.
